## Course Overview

This course covered a wide range of web development technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB and more. Through a combination of lectures and hands-on projects, I gained a solid understanding of these technologies and how to use them to build modern, responsive web applications.

I chose this course because it's one of the best out there for learning web development. Angela is an excellent teacher and her teaching style is very beginner-friendly. She explains concepts clearly and makes sure that students understand the fundamentals before moving on to more advanced topics.

## What I Learned

One of the things I loved about this course is that Angela teaches web development by having students build projects. This hands-on approach really helped me learn how to write code, refactor it, and make responsive websites.

## My Experience

Overall, I had a great experience with this course. I never felt like giving up because Angela's teaching style kept me engaged and motivated. Some of the modules are a bit out of date, but according to her notice, the course is being updated over time. She's already uploaded new videos on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and her team is working on updating the backend modules as well.
